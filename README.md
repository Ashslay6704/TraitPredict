# SpectroPredictR
Script for sweeping through defined directories for sig/sed/asd spectral files and migrating them in for processing and prediction of a host of foliar traits.

When running script, two popup windows will sequentially open.  The first will ask for the folder of spectra.  This is recursive, so choosing a high level folder will mean it searchs all the sub folders.  The second popup will ask for the folder of the models.  Models are separated by folder into **fresh** and **dry**.  Choose the models you will use based on the method used for spectra collection.
